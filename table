<dl>Cricket is played with a bat and ball and involves two competing sides (teams) of 11 players. The field is oval

with a

rectangular area in the middle, known as the pitch, that is 22 yards (20.12 metres) by 10 feet (3.04 metres)

wide. Two

sets of three sticks, called wickets, are set in the ground at each end of the pitch. Across the top of each

wicket lie

horizontal pieces called bails. The sides take turns at batting and bowling (pitching); each turn is called an

“innings”

(always plural). Sides have one or two innings each, depending on the prearranged duration of the match, the

object

being to score the most runs. The bowlers, delivering the ball with a straight arm, try to break (hit) the

wicket with

the ball so that the bails fall. This is one of several ways that the batsman is dismissed, or put out. A bowler

delivers six balls at one wicket (thus completing an “over”), then a different player from his side bowls six

balls to

the opposite wicket. The batting side defends its wicket.

There are two batsman up at a time, and the batsman being bowled to (the striker) tries to hit the ball away

from the

wicket. A hit may be defensive or offensive. A defensive hit may protect the wicket but leave the batsmen no

time to run

to the opposite wicket. In that case the batsmen need not run, and play will resume with another bowl. If the

batsman

can make an offensive hit, he and the second batsman (the nonstriker) at the other wicket change places. Each

time both

batsmen can reach the opposite wicket, one run is scored. Providing they have enough time without being caught

out and

dismissed, the batsmen may continue to cross back and forth between the wickets, earning an additional run for

each time

both reach the opposite side. There is an outside boundary around the cricket field. A ball hit to or beyond the

boundary scores four points if it hits the ground and then reaches the boundary, six points if it reaches the

boundary

from the air (a fly ball). The team with the highest number of runs wins a match. Should both teams be unable to

complete their number of innings before the time allotted, the match is declared a draw. Scores in the hundreds

are

common in cricket.

<li>History-</li>

</ul>

<dl>Cricket is believed to have begun possibly as early as the 13th century as a game in which country boys bowled

at a tree

stump or at the hurdle gate into a sheep pen. This gate consisted of two uprights and a crossbar resting on the

slotted

tops; the crossbar was called a bail and the entire gate a wicket. The fact that the bail could be dislodged

when the

wicket was struck made this preferable to the stump, which name was later applied to the hurdle uprights. Early

manuscripts differ about the size of the wicket, which acquired a third stump in the 1770s, but by 1706 the

pitch—the

area between the wickets—was 22 yards long.</dl>
